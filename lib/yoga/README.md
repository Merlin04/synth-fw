# yoga, stripped to remove c++ stdlib wherever possible

this is a slightly modified version of [facebook/yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga) so that it can run better on a microcontroller (mainly focusing on saving flash space).

(actually idk how many changes I'll actually make but it's nice to have the source here and easy to modify)

> Yoga is an embeddable and performant flexbox layout engine with bindings for multiple languages.
